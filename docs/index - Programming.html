									</a></h2>
									<p>Cluster analysis is an important concept as it helps businesses understand the natural grouping of certain variables in a dataset. Especially for investors, in the case of this project, who want to understand the best portfolios when investing in the stock market. The purpose of this project was to conduct Kmeans clustering to identify the different clusters of the top thirty companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The variables I used were the daily stock returns and the standard deviation of those stocks to input into the Kmeans algorithm. I also plotted a Dendrogram to visualise the hierarchical clustering as well. Sourced the data from yahoo finance using the API.</p>

										<p>The aim of this project was about predicting stock prices of the top three companies on the JSE which are Naspers, BHP and Richemont. Monte Carlo Simulation was the method of choice for the prediction. The period of prediction was 250 days, and a thousand simulations for each stock. I obtained the data using the Yahoo Finance API.</p>

										<p>Over the years there has been a gradual increase in crime and unemployment in South Africa. Therefore, this project aimed to determine if there is a significant correlation between these two variables where the period covered is between 2006 to 2016. In the project, I also demonstrated data cleansing techniques and data visualisation using Python. I obtained the datasets from Kaggle and the SAPS website.</p>

										<p>The purpose of this project was to conduct a forecast on the BRICS Nations' inflation rate over four years. The BRICS consist of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. These countries rank among the world's fastest-growing emerging market economies, thanks to low labour costs, favourable demographics, and abundant natural resources. I acquired the data from the World Bank Data Bank last updated 15 September 2021. The forecasting model implemented was the Auto Regression Model.</p>

										<p>The purpose of conducting this project is to ascertain if good governance and ease of doing business in a country have a relationship with the amount of domestic and foreign investment it receives. I obtained the data from the IMF World Economic Outlook Database and the World Bank Data Bank. I choose three countries, which are New Zealand, South Africa, and Eritrea. The reason I choose these three countries is that for governance and ease of doing business, New Zealand ranks on the upper spectrum, South Africa is in the middle and Eritrea is on the lower end of these rankings, so with this, I thought it would provide a more realistic picture if there were a relationship with investment. Regression Analysis using the train test model will be the method chosen to conduct this statistical analysis.</p>

										<p>The purpose of this project was to determine if a relationship exists between extreme poverty and GDP per Capita, by conducting a regression analysis using the train-test model. My sample group to conduct this analysis was the BRICS nations. The BRICS is an association of five major emerging market economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and usually, in developing countries, there is a higher chance of witnessing extreme poverty than in developed nations. Therefore, this was an appropriate sample to use as we can be able to observe if growing or declining GDP per Capita affects extreme poverty. I obtained the data from Our World in Data and the World Bank Database.</p>

										<p>The purpose of this project was to analyse global income inequality. Income inequality is a phenomenon that occurs when there is an uneven distribution of income throughout a population. According to a United Nations report in 2020 income inequality has been on the rise and has been affecting more than two-thirds of the globe. This project dived into viewing the disparity between the top 1% and the bottom 50% of income earners and did a regression to determine if a relationship exists between the dependent variable of income inequality, measured by the Gini Coefficient, and the independent variables of the unemployment rate, government spending on education (% of GDP), gender inequality and corruption. I collected data from the World Bank Data Bank, Resource Watch and World Inequality Database.</p>
